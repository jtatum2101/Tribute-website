      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of JuiceWRLD's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1998</strong> - Jared Anothey Higgins was born in Chicago, IL on December 2 of 1998.
             He grew up in the South Surburbs spending his childhood in Calumet Park.
              His parents got divorced when he was three years old.
               His father left his mother as a single mother with Juice and his one older brother.
                His mother was very religious and didn't let Jared listen to hip-hop.
                 He listened to a lot of rock and pop music and found a love with video games, especially games like Guitar Hero and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
                  Through these video games, he discovered different artists like Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath,
                   Fall Out Boy, Megadeth, and Panic! at the Disco.
                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
        <li>
          <strong>2009</strong> - Higgins had a extremely strong drug addiction which started in sixth grade
           when he began to drink "lean", which a mixture drink combination of prescription-strength cough medicine,
            soft drinks, and hard, fruit-flavored candy.
             The prescription cough syrups used to make lean drink present the most danger because they often contain codeine,
              an opioid drug.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>2013</strong> - Higgins later moved to Homewood, where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor High School.
           His addiction to substance increased as he began to take percocets (a muscle relaxer)
            and xanax( an anxiety suppressor.) 
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>2015</strong> - He first develop as an artist in his first year of high school.
           His first track, "Forever", was released on a music streamming platform known as SoundCloud in 2015. 
           He released the song under the rapper name, "JuicetheKidd". 
           He would record his first couple of tracks by his cellphone and releasing them on SoundCloud during his sophomore year of high school.
            He changed his name from JuicetheKidd, a name inspired by his affection for rapper Tupac Shakur and his part in the film Juice,
             to Juice Wrld because it "represents taking over the world". 
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>2017</strong> - His first track, "Too Much Cash", was produced by his main producer, Nick Mira.
           While he was releasing music on SoundCloud, Higgins worked in a factory, but he was dissatified with the job. 
           Two weeks later, he was fired from his job.
            He then later joined with a internet collective, Internet Money, where he would release his debut EP, <i>999</i>, on June 15 in 2017.
             One of the songs that appeared on the EP was the famous "Lucid Dreams", which broke out and grew his following.
              He later would release another EP with three songs named <i>Nothings Different</i>. 
              Many hip-hop blogs such as Lyrical Lemonade featured it, which helped Higgins's track "All Girls Are the Same" gain popularity.

        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>2018</strong> - In February 2018, a music video directed by Cole Bennett was released.
           Following the video's release, Interscope Records signed Higgins for $3 million and a remix featuring Lil Yachty was previewed.
            "All Girls Are the Same" was critically praised, receiving a Best New Music designation from Pitchfork. 
            It was released as a single in April.
            <br>
            <br>
             "All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were Higgins's first entries on a Billboard chart, 
             debuting at number 92 and 74 respectively on the Hot 100 chart. 
             <br>
             <br>
             On May 4, 2018, "Lucid Dreams" was released officially as a single and given a video.
              It peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and quickly became one of the most streamed songs of 2018; it remains his most-streamed song, reaching over one billion streams on Spotify by January 2020.

               <br>
               <br>
                On June 19, 2018, he released a two-song EP, Too Soon.. in remembrance of, and dedicated to,
                 deceased rappers Lil Peep and XXXTentacion. Lil Peep died of an overdose in 2017
                  and XXXTentacion was shot and killed during a robbery attempt a day earlier.

                   <br>
                   Future & Juice Wrld Present... Wrld on Drugs is a collaborative mixtape by American rappers Future and Juice Wrld.
                    It was released on October 19, 2018 by Epic Records, Freebandz, Grade A and Interscope Records
                     after being originally announced on October 17, 2018.

                     <br>
                   With his debut album getting him more and more ground, Higgins' music has been branded as "emo" and "rock" leaning,
                    "genre-bending" with music focusing on "every broken heart, every wounded feeling". 
                   More specifically, he has been labeled as a hip hop, trap, emo rap, and SoundCloud rap artist. 
                   With a penchant for short, hook-heavy songs, Higgins seemed a leading figure for the current era of
                    hip-hop.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2018, the streaming platform Spotify named "emo rap" its fastest growing genre. 
                    Higgins achieved arguably the most mainstream success of any artist in the sub-genre. 
                    This was boosted by his collaboration with Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie. 
                    Higgins himself considered the emo label to be both negative and positive. 
                    He felt that music sometimes has to be a bit dark to reflect his belief
                    that the world is not really a light or a happy place. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In December 2018, Ski Mask the Slump God, a friend of JuiceWrld and XXXTentacion and famous rapper,  confirmed that he would release a joint mixtape with Higgins called Evil Twins in 2019.
                     The pair also announced a 2019 tour featuring 30 concerts across North America.

          <strong>2019</strong> - Higgins would release his second-album, <i>A Death Race for Love</i> , on March 8 of 2019.
           The album consisted of 22 songs, including the well-known "Robbery" and "Hear Me Calling".
            The album topped the Billboard 200 chart.
            <br>
            <br>
            He would then embarked on The Nicki Wrld Tour, alongside Trinidadian-American rapper Nicki Minaj.
            Higgins released the music video for the song "Fast" from the album.
            <br><br>
            Later that year, he released other singles: 
            "All Night" with RM and Suga of BTS; 
            "Hate Me" with Ellie Goulding; "Run";
            "Graduation" with Benny Blanco;
            and "Bandit" with NBA YoungBoy, the last song to be released while he was alive.
            It peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.
            <br>
            <br>
            On December 8, 2019, Higgins suffered a medical emergency at Chicago's Midway International Airport and died.
             He had just turned 21.
              At the time of his death, he had three singles in the Hot 100 and both official LPs in the Top 100 on the Billboard 200.
            During the next several months, his verses appeared on tracks with Halsey, Marshmello, and Eminem.
             The posthumous album Legends Never Die followed in July of 2020 and topped the Billboard 200.

          pure talent. It's really sad that we lost him at such a young age."
